This is a very simple React app that renders some property data.

## Features

- Search Filter: Filter properties by description.
- Placeholder for Missing Photos: Properties without photos now display a placeholder image to prevent broken image links.
- Save/Unsave Properties:
  - Users can save properties by clicking the bookmark icon. Saved properties are added to the savedProperties array, and the bookmark icon turns red.
  - Clicking the bookmark icon again unsaves the property, removing it from the savedProperties array and changing the icon back to yellow.
